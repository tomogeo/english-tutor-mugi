// The files the dev server never serves to the browser (vite.config.ts → server.fs.deny). Vite matches a pattern that has no
// "/" in it as "**/<pattern>", but a pattern that contains "/" is matched as written, against the absolute path. So the
// folders of this project must be written as "**/<folder>/**"; ".usage/**" alone matches nothing and the files were served.
// The first entries are Vite's own defaults (fs.deny is replaced when set, so they are repeated here).
// tests: src/game/__tests__/fsDeny.test.ts checks these with Vite's isFileServingAllowed.
